[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a valuable resource and a leading container management system in development pipelines across the
world, but it’s not exempt from malicious attacks. Using Kubernetes requires a deep understanding of Kubernetes’ environment—including the
different vulnerabilities you can be exposed to while creating, deploying, or running applications in your clusters.

Since your Kubernetes cluster is likely one of your most valuable cloud resources, it needs to be protected. Kubernetes’ security addresses
the safety of your cloud, application clusters, containers, apps and code. Although Kubernetes provides inherent security advantages,
bolstering your defensive tactics is crucial to protecting your system against hackers and other cybersecurity threats. 

This roundup covers the top seven ways your cluster is likely to be attacked, with a corresponding countermeasure for each.

## Why do you need defense tactics to avoid getting hacked?

Because of the distributed, dynamic nature of a Kubernetes cluster, you need to implement defensive tactics that follow the best security
practices [throughout the container lifecycle](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/kubernetes-security.html).

While several security issues exist with Kubernetes throughout the application lifecycle (build, deploy, and runtime), some of the most
critical security concerns include:

* **Using codes from unverified open source public registries:** This can create backdoors for threat actors to exploit — giving them access
  to your critical assets. To protect the software supply chain  from malware. 

* **Failing to follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP):** PoLP ensures you limit the privileges that users have access to. According
  to the
  [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege#:~:text=The%20Principle%20of%20Least%20Privilege%20states%20that%20a%20subject%20should,control%20the%20assignment%20of%20rights),
  if a subject doesn’t need an access right, the subject should not have that right. Granting unnecessary privileges widens the attack
  surface and creates more security loopholes for attackers to pounce on. 

* **Building complex Kubernetes clusters:** This makes it difficult to isolate and replace compromised clusters when there’s an attack,
hampering the remediation process. Therefore, developing adequate defense strategies is key to keeping your clusters protected from bad
actors and misconfigurations at all times. 

## The top seven defense tactics for protecting your Kubernetes clusters

While Kubernetes enables some essential security measures by default, developers must explore the best security practices to ensure the
safety of their clusters. 

The defense tactics in this article were selected based on industry standard best practices for preventing a Kubernetes hack. It includes
comments made by several experts to explain how and why these strategies will help to secure Kubernetes workloads and mitigate cloud
environment risk.

### 1.  ABAC vs. RBAC

While attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a great access control method, it’s complex to understand and manage. Apart from its
complexity, ABAC grants access rights to users based on user attributes like subject attributes, resource attributes, and environmental
attributes. ABAC enables cluster-wide permission for users to do whatever they want: create resources in the cluster, view secrets, delete
codes and more. It doesn’t ensure maximum protection and can have catastrophic consequences.

Kubernetes announced the release of [Kubernetes 1.6](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/03/kubernetes-1-6-multi-user-multi-workloads-at-scale/)
on March, 28, 2017, stating that “Role-based access control (RBAC),
[kubefed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/federation/set-up-cluster-federation-kubefed/),
[kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/), and other scheduling features were moving to beta.” Moving RBAC to
beta was a major highlight of this announcement. Andrew Grant, co-founder of [Control Plane](https://control-plane.io/) and coauthor of
[Hacking Kubernetes](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-kubernetes/9781492081722/), noted in an
[article](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/18/11-ways-not-to-get-hacked/) that ABAC has been superseded by RBAC since release 1.6, and
that it should not be used on the API server. 

According to Grant, disabling ABAC and enabling RBAC with least privilege offer powerful protection against getting hacked. Unlike ABAC,
RBAC grants access rights to users based on their roles. For example, while a DevOps team may have access to programming files, a project
management team will have access to all the project files. That’s an example of what RBAC does — enabling permissions based on the functions
of users.

You can enable RBAC by starting the kube-apiserver with the `--authorization-mode` flag:

```shell
kube-apiserver --authorization-mode=Example,RBAC --other-options --more-options
```

More details on RBAC can be found in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and
[Kubernetes API Access Hardening](/kubernetes-api-access-security/).

### 2. Monitor the logs

Another way to prevent your clusters being hacked is to ensure that you monitor logs and audit them regularly for suspicious activities like
unusual or unwanted API calls—especially authentication failures. Although audit logging helps with analysis and identifying trends over
time, [notes Amir Kaushansky](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-audit-log-security/), VP of Products at Armo, it’s most commonly used
by organizations to monitor Kubernetes cluster performance and enforce security.

For example, if a log entry displays a message status like “Forbidden,” which was not authorized by a cluster administrator, it could mean
that an attacker is trying to use stolen credentials. Kubernetes users can access this data in their console and set up notifications for
authorization failures.

Audit logging enables customizable event logging. You can set one of the four API logging levels:

* None
* Metadata only
* Request: this logs metadata and requests but not responses
* RequestResponse: logs metadata, requests, and responses

**Note:** Keeping these logs inside clusters poses a security threat, as compromise on a sector of any cluster might provide hackers with
the logs stored in that cluster and jeopardize the overall security of your clusters. Any sensitive logs should be transported outside the
cluster to mitigate risk.

To enable audit logging, you need to use the `--audit-policy-file` flag while starting kube-apiserver. The policy file contains the rules
which dictate what will be logged. Here’s an example policy template file:

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
# Ignore all requests in RequestReceived stage.
omitStages:
  - "RequestReceived"
rules:
  # Log pod changes at RequestResponse level
  - level: RequestResponse
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["pods"]
```

### 3. Rotate encryption keys regularly

One of the best security practices to protect your Kubernetes against malicious actors is regularly rotating encryption keys and
certificates. By default, these certificates are issued with a year-long expiration date so that you don’t have to renew them frequently.
However, you can also customize them to a time more suitable for you. 

Kubernetes enables encryption keys and certificate rotation to automatically generate a new key and request a new certificate from the API
server as the current certificate approaches expiration. Once the new certificate is available, it will authenticate connections to the
Kubernetes API. This process saves time by ensuring the user doesn’t need to frequently rotate keys and certificates. 

In addition, it’s essential to always encrypt your backups using a well-reviewed backup encryption solution, and consider using full disk
encryption where possible.

Rotating encryption keys and certificates regularly limits the damage in the event of a key compromise. Thankfully, Kubernetes’ automated
process of changing keys and certificates removes the possibility of human failure: a leak of sensitive keys.

### 4. Update your Kubernetes version

As simple as it may seem, keeping Kubernetes up to date is an excellent way to keep clusters safe from attacks. To get a sense of how secure
your current version is, you can find a list of Kubernetes vulnerabilities on this [CVE
list](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-15867/product_id-34016/Kubernetes-Kubernetes.html).

For developers who use a hosted provider such as AWS EKS, check if your provider automatically updates your Kubernetes version. 

### 5. Whitelist application processes

Process whitelisting helps to identify processes that run unexpectedly.
 
The first step to using process whitelisting to protect Kubernetes is to observe and identify every process that runs when an application
behaves normally. Next, use this list as a whitelist to check for any anomalies in future application behaviors.

If a hacker manages to access your cluster and runs harmful processes, the whitelist helps you to swiftly identify and flag such
irregularities.

### 6. Run containers as a non-root user

Running containers as a root user exposes you to security breaches. As tech columnist Raquel Campuzano Godoy puts it [on
Bitnami](https://engineering.bitnami.com/articles/why-non-root-containers-are-important-for-security.html#:~:text=Because%20anyone%20who%20accesses%20your,which%20makes%20your%20application%20vulnerable),
“Anyone who accesses your container running as `root` can start undesirable processes in it — such as injecting malicious codes”. Running
your docker containers as a root user also makes your applications vulnerable because it enables users to change the user ID or group ID
when they start the container.

Reconfiguring your containers from `root` to `non-root` provides an additional layer of protection that secures you against hackers. A
selection of non-root image containers tagged “non-root” is available here on [Bitnami’s GitHub
repository](https://github.com/search?q=bitnami&type=Repositories).

To run a container as a `non-root`, you need to set the `securitycontext` field to specify exactly what permissions the container should
have. In this context, you need to set the `securitycontext.runAsUser` and `securityContext.runAsGroup` to run containers as a non-root
user.

[Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod) is how to configure a security context for a pod or container.

### 7. Audit `kubectl` usage

Integrating Kubernetes with a third-party authentication provider like [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) is another effective way to
protect your clusters against threat actors. It provides additional security features such as multi-factor authentication and ensures there
are no changes to the `kube-api` server when users are added or removed.

Teleport offers an identity-based access proxy for multiple Kubernetes clusters. User certificates are issued after their identities are
validated by single sign-on (SSO) providers such as Okta, GitHub, Google Apps, and others. [Teleport Kubernetes
Access](https://goteleport.com/how-it-works/secure-kubernetes-access/) offers a simple, unified way to access all environments via a single
access point, using the same identity provider. This provides the same role-based access (RBAC) rules for all your Kubernetes clusters and
resources — ensuring secure access to them. 

Teleport delivers hardened security best practices to companies. Use it to:

* Secure your Kubernetes clusters while meeting compliance requirements
* Secure access to underlying linux infrasture 
* Prevent honeypot attacks and eliminate the issue of trust on first use
* Allow users to enumerate all servers and other current online resources
* Improve visibility into access and behavior across your infrastructure
* Full playback for `kubectl execs` 
* Reduce the operational overhead of enforcing security best practices

## Conclusion

While many DevOps teams enable default security measures that come with Kubernetes, these measures aren’t enough to keep clusters protected
from attacks. Vigilant DevOps teams need to do more to create the walls necessary to stop hackers from infiltrating their systems.
